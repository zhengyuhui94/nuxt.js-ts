**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

此目录包含您的静态文件。  
此目录中的每个文件都映射到' / '。  
因此，您需要删除README。部署到生产之前的md。

This directory contains your static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).
